## Feature Scaling

> [!INFO]
>  **Feature scaling** (also known as **data normalization**) is the method used to standardize the range of features of data. Since, the range of values of data may vary widely, it becomes a necessary step in data preprocessing while using machine learning algorithms.

# Info on the attributes
> [!INFO]
> The **Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System** consists of six components that account for the effects of fuel moisture and weather conditions on fire behavior. The diagram below illustrates the components of the FWI System. Calculation of the components is based on consecutive daily observations of **temperature, relative humidity, wind speed,** and **24-hour precipitation**. The six standard components provide numeric ratings of relative potential for wildland fire. ![Structure of the Fire Weather Index (FWI) System](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/images/fwi_structure.gif)


## Attributes in the dataset related to FWI index
### Fine Fuel Moisture Code

The Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) is a numeric rating of the moisture content of litter and other cured fine fuels. This code is an indicator of the relative ease of ignition and the flammability of fine fuel.

### Duff Moisture Code

The Duff Moisture Code (DMC) is a numeric rating of the average moisture content of loosely compacted organic layers of moderate depth. This code gives an indication of fuel consumption in moderate duff layers and medium-size woody material.

### Drought Code

The Drought Code (DC) is a numeric rating of the average moisture content of deep, compact organic layers. This code is a useful indicator of seasonal drought effects on forest fuels and the amount of smoldering in deep duff layers and large logs.

### Initial Spread Index

The Initial Spread Index (ISI) is a numeric rating of the expected rate of fire spread. It is based on wind speed and FFMC. Like the rest of the FWI system components, ISI does not take fuel type into account. Actual spread rates vary between fuel types at the same ISI.

### Temperature
Indicates the temperature of the location at that time 

### Wind 


### Rain
