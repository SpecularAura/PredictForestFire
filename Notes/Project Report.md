## Problem Statement    

Every year forest fires destroy a huge area of forest cover, leaving large-scale destruction of flora and fauna in it's wake. Forest fires play a major role in driving thousands of species of wildlife to extinction every year. Artificial intelligence helps us predict the future and using it in this domain can successfully help us predict forest fires and save the wildlife.    

## Objectives    

-   Provide real-time visual reference of forest fire probability around the world.
-   Minimize damage and if possibly prevent it.
-   Providing early contingency warning for upcoming wildfires.
## Scope    

### 2019-2020 Australian Bushfires    

- Australia was hit hard by bushfires during summer 2019-20 - the most catastrophic bushfire season ever experienced in the country’s history. So much was lost, and the impacts will be felt for years to come.
- Early in January 2020, WWF estimated that at that time, 1.25 billion animals had been killed. As the fires raged well into March, and destroyed even more habitat, we had a scientific duty to update that figure to understand the true impact on our wildlife and natural landscapes.
- Up to 19 million hectares were burnt, with 12.6 million hectares primarily forest and bushland. 33 lives were lost and around 3,094 homes destroyed.

Using an AI model to provide real-time updates on the the status of wildfire will help avert 

# **Literature Survey**    


## Literature/Techniques studied    
Information about the dataset:    
Real-world data, from the northeast region of Portugal, is present in the dataset from UCI Repositoery. The database included spatial, temporal, components from the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) and four weather conditions. This park contains a high flora and fauna diversity. Inserted within a supra-Mediterranean climate, the average annual temperature is within the range 8 to 12◦C. The data used in the experiments was collected from January 2000 to December 2003 and it was built using two sources. At a daily basis, every time a forest fire occurred, several features were registered, such as the time, date, spatial location , the type of vegetation involved, the six components of the FWI system and the total burned area

Previous Projects used these ML algorithms to train their model:    
1. ANN(Artificial Neural Networks)
2. SVM(Support Vector Machines)
3. DNF(Disjunctive Normal Form)

## Papers/Findings    
The results obtained from the models were compared with the other machine learning models. Among the models the DNF model gave the highest average accuracy with 97.8% among the other machine learning models. SVM used two class predictions of fire risk. The results demonstrated that the accuracy of SVM was approximately 96%. ANN was used in two stages: classifying forest fires size and evaluation of the burned surface areas. The results of prediction were over 60%, and could reach more than 70% in some central area.
The advantage of SVM over DNF is that SVM based algorithm requires only four direct weather inputs (i.e. temperature, rain, relative humidity and wind speed) is capable of predicting small fires, which is compatible with dataset being used to train the data
